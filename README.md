This branch contains jupyter notebooks (casename_validation.ipynb) that validates the microphysical properties for CAIPEEX, DCMEX, MC3E, & STEPS. These properties are LWC, DCNC, IWC, & TINC. For ORCESTRA, EarthCare data needs to be processed, so no such validation is shown in the current notebook of orcestra. In future, this should be done!
The files, 'casename_other_analysis.ipynb' includes analysis of ICON runs, simulated with 4-SIP, No raindrop shattering (No RF), No Hallett-Mossop (No HM), No ice-ice collision (No IIC), No sublimation breakup (No SB).
